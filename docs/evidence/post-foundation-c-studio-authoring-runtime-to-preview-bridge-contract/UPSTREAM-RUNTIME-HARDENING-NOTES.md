Records observations the future bridge must account for: the runtime's single-draft fallback (bridge requires an explicit draft id) and unknown-resource-dimension leniency (bridge rejects unknown dimensions); FNV-1a is internal-only. These are **notes** — the runtime is **not** altered by this slice (`runtimeAlteredByThisSlice` = false). Hardening is required before any certification or production.

## What this slice does NOT do

This slice implements **no** bridge, adapter, source-validation runtime, target payload or preview mount. It creates **no** UI, editor, React component, `.jsx`/`.tsx`/`.css`, App/router/menu/sidebar wiring. It never persists, writes the filesystem, touches backend/Prisma/migration/network/production/staging, reads or writes real data, generates or registers a module, certifies/self-certifies/overwrites the certified SSOT, integrates a permission/tenant model, or relinks the old Studio prototype. The certified blueprint remains the canonical SSOT.
