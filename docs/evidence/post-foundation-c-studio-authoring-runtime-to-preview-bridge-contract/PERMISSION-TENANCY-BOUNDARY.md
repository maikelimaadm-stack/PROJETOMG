# Permission / Tenancy Boundary

No permission model, tenant model or server-side authorization is integrated; client-side authorization is explicitly insufficient. Product exposure is blocked until a dedicated Permission/Tenancy foundation exists (`requiresPermissionTenancyFoundationBeforeExposure` = true). No auth module is imported.

## What this slice does NOT do

This slice implements **no** bridge, adapter, source-validation runtime, target payload or preview mount. It creates **no** UI, editor, React component, `.jsx`/`.tsx`/`.css`, App/router/menu/sidebar wiring. It never persists, writes the filesystem, touches backend/Prisma/migration/network/production/staging, reads or writes real data, generates or registers a module, certifies/self-certifies/overwrites the certified SSOT, integrates a permission/tenant model, or relinks the old Studio prototype. The certified blueprint remains the canonical SSOT.
