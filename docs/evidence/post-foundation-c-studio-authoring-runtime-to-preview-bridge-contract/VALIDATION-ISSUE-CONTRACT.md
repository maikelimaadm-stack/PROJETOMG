# Validation Issue Contract

Each bridge validation issue is a deterministic, sanitized descriptor: `issueCode`, `severity` (`info`/`warning`/`error`/`blocker`), `stage`, `path`, `message`. `error` and `blocker` severities block **both** the bridge and the preview-sandbox handoff. Issues carry no secrets and are never auto-corrected.

## What this slice does NOT do

This slice implements **no** bridge, adapter, source-validation runtime, target payload or preview mount. It creates **no** UI, editor, React component, `.jsx`/`.tsx`/`.css`, App/router/menu/sidebar wiring. It never persists, writes the filesystem, touches backend/Prisma/migration/network/production/staging, reads or writes real data, generates or registers a module, certifies/self-certifies/overwrites the certified SSOT, integrates a permission/tenant model, or relinks the old Studio prototype. The certified blueprint remains the canonical SSOT.
