Sixteen fixed-order phases (`phase_0_preflight` … `phase_15_rollout_blocked`). Each declares goal, entry/exit criteria, allowed effects (only `emit_plan_metadata`), blocked effects (implement_bridge / create_target_payload / mount_preview / persist / generate_module / certify / expose_product / touch_app), and a rollback plan. **Every phase is `planned`; none is `implemented` or `completed`.** `allPlanned` = true, `anyImplemented` = false.

## Plan, not implementation

This slice is a **plan**, not an implementation. Every phase is `planned`, none `implemented` or `completed`. It implements **no** bridge, adapter, source validator, target payload builder or preview mount. It creates **no** UI, editor, React component, `.jsx`/`.tsx`/`.css`, App/router/menu/sidebar wiring. It never persists, writes the filesystem, touches backend/Prisma/migration/network/production/staging, reads or writes real data, generates or registers a module, certifies/self-certifies/overwrites the certified SSOT, integrates a permission/tenant model, or relinks the old Studio prototype. The certified blueprint remains the canonical SSOT. Permission/Tenancy remains obligatory before any product exposure.
