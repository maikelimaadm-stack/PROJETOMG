This slice authorizes the bridge **implementation plan** only. It does **not** authorize the bridge contract (already certified), a real bridge implementation, or anything real (preview mount, UI, editor, App touch, route/menu, persistence, filesystem, backend, prisma, module generation, certification, product exposure, production, real data). The required future checkpoint is `pre_authoring_runtime_to_preview_bridge_implementation_enterprise_checkpoint`.

## Plan, not implementation

This slice is a **plan**, not an implementation. Every phase is `planned`, none `implemented` or `completed`. It implements **no** bridge, adapter, source validator, target payload builder or preview mount. It creates **no** UI, editor, React component, `.jsx`/`.tsx`/`.css`, App/router/menu/sidebar wiring. It never persists, writes the filesystem, touches backend/Prisma/migration/network/production/staging, reads or writes real data, generates or registers a module, certifies/self-certifies/overwrites the certified SSOT, integrates a permission/tenant model, or relinks the old Studio prototype. The certified blueprint remains the canonical SSOT. Permission/Tenancy remains obligatory before any product exposure.
